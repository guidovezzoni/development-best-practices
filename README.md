# development-best-practices
A collection of processes and guidelines for developers

**Please note: Work In Progress**

From Wikipedia:
_"A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things"_

Changing companies and projects I always find myself writing down the same guidelines from scratch, the idea is to use this wiki as a single source of truth for the projects I'll be involved with in future.
